Description
===================
I just cleaned up the base administration theme: cleaned up some of the presentation, made it wider, and tweaked some of the jQuery UI css. I imagine it isn't error free, so feel free to modify for your particular situation.

Installation Instructions
===================
1. Unzip files and upload the 'admin/clean' folder to your admin themes folder located at /base_pancake_directory/third_party/themes/admin/
2. Unzip files and upload the 'clean' folder to your regular themes folder located at /base_pancake_directory/third_party/themes/
3. Go to settings>general and set the admin theme to 'clean.'
